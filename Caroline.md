Objectives: To provide an addressing scheme for four different sized companies, that meets their requirements, with the constraints of 206.12.0.0/17 and the solution must use Variable Length Subnet Mask.  

Equipment List: Our team used pencil and paper to sketch out ideas. Blender to create a 3-D model. Google Slides to create a slide for information.  

Notes and Observations: For the challenge, our group went through a few different ideas before deciding on creating a subnet with 4.
